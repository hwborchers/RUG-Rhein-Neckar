*Information about the Meetup R User Group Rhein-Neckar, Germany*

R (<http://www.r-project.org/>) is a free software environment for statistical data processing, graphics and visualization. It includes an interpreted programming language, which can be extended through functions and packages. Due to this flexibility, but also due to the fact that R is open source software, it has becoming increasingly popular in the field of statistics and other disciplines in which statistical methods are used.
