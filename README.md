# RUG-Rhein-Neckar

*Information about the Meetup R User Group Rhein-Neckar, Germany*

Please note: Due to the coronavirus pandemic, all meetings will be held online until further notice.

R (<http://www.r-project.org/>) is a free software environment for statistical data processing, graphics and visualization. It includes an interpreted programming language, which can be extended through functions and packages. Due to this flexibility, but also due to the fact that R is open source software, it has become increasingly popular in the field of statistics and other disciplines in which statistical methods are used.


## Meetings

Information about current and planned meetings can be found on the Meetup Page [R User Group Rhein-Neckar](https://www.meetup.com/R-User-Group-Rhein-Neckar/).

There will be meetings with one or two presentations or 'lightning talks', but there will also be meetings with no agenda or prepared talks. These could be discussions focussing on certain aspects of R or -- hopefully in the future again -- social gatherings in restaurants or beer gardens.

**Online Meetings**  
The ONLINE meetings will utilize video conferencing software such as [ZOOM](https://zoom.us/), [JITSI](https://jitsi.org/), or Google MEET. All of these are available for notebooks, but also as apps for Android or Apple's iOS. Listening to an event is possible by just dialing a certain phone number.

**RStudio Conference 2020**  
_30 January 2020_  
The yearly RStudio conferences -- this year in San Francisco, January 27-30  -- always come up with interesting topics. Videos can be found on [RStudio Conference 2020](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020). I personally found the talk "State of the tidyverse" by Hadley Wickham quite illuminating.
