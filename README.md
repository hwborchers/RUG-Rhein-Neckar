# RUG-Rhein-Neckar

*Information about the Meetup R User Group Rhein-Neckar, Germany*

R (<http://www.r-project.org/>) is a free software environment for statistical data processing, graphics and visualization. It includes an interpreted programming language, which can be extended through functions and packages. Due to this flexibility, but also due to the fact that R is open source software, it has become increasingly popular in the field of statistics and other disciplines in which statistical methods are used.


## Meetings 2020

Information about the official meetings 2020 can be found on the Meetup Page [R User Group Rhein-Neckar](https://www.meetup.com/R-User-Group-Rhein-Neckar/). Please note that because of the corona virus pandemic all further meetings have been postponed to some time later this year.

**Online Meetings**  
Still, we are thinking about ONLINE meetings during this summer, utilizing video conferencing software such as [ZOOM](https://zoom.us/), [JITSI](https://jitsi.org/), or even Google MEET. All of these are available for notebooks, but also as apps for Android or Apple's iOS.


## News

**UseR 2020 Conference**  
_10 July 2020_  
The "UseR 2020 Conference" (and its "European Hub") from July 7--11 was/were held as an online event. The video talks are available on [Contributed sessions](https://user2020.r-project.org/program/contributed/) and on Youtube. My favorite here was "Arbitrary precision linear algebra in R using RcppEigen and BH" as it answered a question I had some time ago.  
The 'Breakout' and 'keynote' sessions can be found on the [Agenda](https://user2020.r-project.org/program/agenda/) page, a three hour recording at [Welcome and R core event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_eDHNVceCU&feature=youtu.be). For instance, the discussion on "New Developments in R 4.0.0 and Beyond" starts at 1:34 hours.

**RStudio cheatsheets page**  
_30 June 2020_  
The [cheatsheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) page at RStudio now lists 12 cheat sheets from RStudio and 36 contributed cheat sheets! Among the contributions there are sheets about special R packages such as 'data.table', 'leaflet', or 'mlr'.

**RStudio Conference 2020**  
_30 January 2020_  
The yearly RStudio conferences -- this year in San Francisco, January 27-30  -- always come up with interesting topics. Videos can be found on [RStudio Conference 2020](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020). I personally found the talk "State of the tidyverse" by Hadley Wickham quite illuminating.
